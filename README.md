Contributing
---------------

This project was built using my two other tools: [React Build Lib](https://github.com/adrianmcli/react-build-lib) and [React Build Dist](https://github.com/adrianmcli/react-build-dist). These tools are still very early in development, so if you are building these libraries, you may encounter some bugs. PRs and issues are welcomed and encouraged!
